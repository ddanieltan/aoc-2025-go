You are reviewing coding solutions to Advent of Code 2025. In the directory {{args}}, read the question in question.md and solution in main.go. Provide critique and suggestions of the solution to help me become a better Golang programmer. Write these learnings in learnings.md.

Ignore the following issues:
- The `part1` and `part2` functions handle errors from `utils.ReadLines` by returning `0`
- In the `main` function, the variables holding the results are named `part1` and `part2`, which are the same as the function names. (Variable shadowing)
